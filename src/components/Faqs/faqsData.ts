    question: `What makes you different?`,
    answer: [
      `The nature of UX design demands iteration. The old per project, agency model worked counter to that. You spend ages mapping out specific features, only for things to change part way through.`,
      `Queue pricey change requests and revolving teams.`,
      `Nobodies happy.`,
      `You could hire a contractor â€” spend ages onboarding only to have to do that all over again when they inevitably take on another contract. What's left in their wake? A trail of design debt and lost knowledge.`,
      `You want to build a relationship that matures like a fine wine.`,
      `So we decided to use a subscription model. Now you can expect a 'let's do it', not a 'hmm that's gonna cost you'.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `How do you handle feedback`,
    answer: [
      `We work on your design until you're happy, but we also use testing and evidence to make decisions instead of subjective opinion.`,
      `We don't do endless meetings, we've found asynchronous video design walkthroughs are far faster and more effective at moving projects forward.`,
      `We send you a video walkthrough, which you can watch at your convenience.`,
      `There is no 'big reveal' or Director ego here. This is about you and what you want to accomplish.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `How quickly can you turn a design request around?`,
    answer: [
      `We aim for within 3 business days. If you need quicker turnaround times, you can upgrade to Pathfinder Plus, where we'll deliver within 1-2 days depending on the size of the request.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `What kind of design requests can I make?`,
    answer: [
      `Other customers have used our services to: improve a feature or flow. Optimise a design element. Modernise a design. Create or explore ideas and new features. Create a prototype to test.`,
      `We provide a request format to make things easy and help you provide the info we need to address your request efficiently.`,
      `Larger requests will take us longer, so sometimes it makes sense to break it down into chunks.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `Who uses your service?`,
    answer: [
      `We work with customer-obsessed product teams that lack in-house design skills covering UX design, UI design, prototyping and creative direction.`,
      `This is typically a SaaS company, or an innovation unit within an established company or SME. Most have strong engineering teams already, but no design team.`,
      `We do product design UI/UX. We don't do social media graphics or print collateral.`,
    ],
  },
  {
    question: `What software do you use?`,
    answer: [
      `We use Figma, Framer, Notion, Eyequant, Hotjar and a variety of AI tools. We keep right at the edge of design & tech so you don't have to.`,
    ],
  },
